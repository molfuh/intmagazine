Or is it? As wonderful as it is to have your baby (or toddler) progressing in their development, it means you as the mom have <em>even less <\/em>time to yourself! Now your little munchkin is fully aware of when (and if) you are paying attention to them, and guess what? If you\u2019re not, they will make you, by getting into something they shouldn\u2019t, or crawling to an area where you don\u2019t want them to go, or walking and falling and hurting themselves. Ahhh, Motherhood.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So how are you, the mother, supposed to get ANYTHING done? It\u2019s hard enough to get the dishes cleaned much less get a workout in, when all your child wants is their mommy to pay attention to them.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So here is it is<strong>: NURSERY RHYME WORKOUT TIME.&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Here\u2019s the truth:<\/strong> Children love music and they especially love it when their Mommy sings to them.&nbsp; So here\u2019s some fun suggestions of how to bond and play with your baby, without feeling guilty that you\u2019re burning calories at the same time. I mean\u2026 what they don\u2019t know doesn\u2019t hurt them.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>ITSY BITSY SPIDER:<\/strong> Lay your baby down, or if they are sitting up, sit them next to you on the carpet, and sing the song and BE THE SPIDER by doing mountain climbers or spider crawls while you sing the song.&nbsp; If you have an active toddler, have them do with you! You physically <em>are<\/em> the itsy bitsy spider and gosh darnit you\u2019ll be sweating when you get to the water spout!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Fitness tip: repeat 3x and go at different speeds, go hyper fast and hyper slow.\u00a0 (For an even extra calorie burn, do 3 sets of mountain climbers AND 3 sets of spider crawls.) \u00a0<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"316\" height=\"238\" src=\"https:\/\/intmagazine.wpcomstaging.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/Screen-Shot-2021-06-02-at-11.15.39-AM.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-302\" srcset=\"https:\/\/intmagazine.wpcomstaging.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/Screen-Shot-2021-06-02-at-11.15.39-AM.png 316w, https:\/\/intmagazine.wpcomstaging.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/Screen-Shot-2021-06-02-at-11.15.39-AM-300x226.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 316px) 100vw, 316px\" \/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>OLD MACDONALD:<\/strong> He had a Farm. Which means there are a ton of animals for you to re-enact! My personal favorites for the best burn, are the Frog (Hello squat jumps!), The Dog (Downward Dog), and The Chicken (Jumping jacks looks like a bird flapping its wings).&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"alignright size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"199\" height=\"212\" src=\"https:\/\/intmagazine.wpcomstaging.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/Screen-Shot-2021-06-02-at-11.15.44-AM.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-303\"\/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p><em>&nbsp;Fitness Tip: Sing the song with your<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>&nbsp;non verbal baby, and keep repeating&nbsp;<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>the frog, the dog, and the chicken, 3x.&nbsp;<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>&nbsp;(or for even more of a burn,<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>&nbsp;time yourself for 5 minutes!)&nbsp;<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For a Toddler who knows the song and wants to be interactive with you: Literally jump and crawl all over your house as each animal. They are going to have so much fun, they won\u2019t ever need to go to the zoo!&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>ROW, ROW, ROW YOUR BOAT:<\/strong> Ever heard of a Back Row? The motion that a rower makes when actually rowing a boat is a powerful one. Hence, why people on a crew team have such muscular backs.&nbsp; There are many ways to do this exercise, you can do single arm rows or double. My best advice is to take a resistance band (you can buy a cheap one at any local sporting goods store), wrap it around your feet (as pictured) so that your legs are straight in front of you, so that the band is tight and you have each handle in your hand. Sit in your \u201cboat\u201d, so to speak, next to your baby or toddler and sing the song, and actually \u201cRow a boat\u201d. Stick your chest out, and take your elbows as far back as you can so that your shoulder blades touch, squeeze you shoulder blades together and then straighten your arms back out in front of you. Keep repeating the motion for the entire song. You\u2019ll feel it trust me! And your toddler will be saying \u201caye aye mommy!\u201d.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Fitness tip: Keep amping up the resistance and repeat the song 3x. You can also do this with weights, however keep them light weights so you don\u2019t accidentally hurt your little one while rowing the boat.\u00a0<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"345\" height=\"229\" src=\"https:\/\/intmagazine.wpcomstaging.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/Screen-Shot-2021-06-02-at-11.16.13-AM.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-304\" srcset=\"https:\/\/intmagazine.wpcomstaging.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/Screen-Shot-2021-06-02-at-11.16.13-AM.png 345w, https:\/\/intmagazine.wpcomstaging.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/Screen-Shot-2021-06-02-at-11.16.13-AM-300x199.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 345px) 100vw, 345px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Some other Nursery rhyme favorites to get physical with:<\/strong> \u201cHead, shoulders, knees, and toes\u201d (pretty self explanatory), and the \u201cHokey Pokey\u201d.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;<em>\u201cThat\u2019s what it\u2019s all about!\u201d<\/em><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Your baby is mobile now.
