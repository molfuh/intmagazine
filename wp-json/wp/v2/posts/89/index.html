The two come from very different<br>backgrounds, with Collins being a former star on the show \u201cPretty Little Liars\u201d and<br>Shaheen being the daughter of a U.S Senator, but they both share a love for fashion<br>that ultimately inspired them to create Wheat Boutique.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><br>The brand\u2019s namesake came about as a result of a trip to Paris in 2016 upon which<br>Shaheen and Collins visited Coco Chanel\u2019s former apartment. On the tour, Shaheen<br>couldn\u2019t help but notice all the motifs and symbols of wheat throughout the apartment.<br>Later, she learned of Chanel\u2019s strong belief in wheat\u2019s power of prosperity, and<br>Shaheen knew it was something she wanted to use as inspiration in her own life. Thus,<br>Wheat Boutique was born.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" src=\"https:\/\/intmagazine.wpcomstaging.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/IMG-0880-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-91\" srcset=\"https:\/\/intmagazine.wpcomstaging.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/IMG-0880-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/intmagazine.wpcomstaging.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/IMG-0880-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/intmagazine.wpcomstaging.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/IMG-0880-768x512.jpg 768w, https:\/\/intmagazine.wpcomstaging.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/IMG-0880-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https:\/\/intmagazine.wpcomstaging.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/IMG-0880-2048x1366.jpg 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p><br>Wheat is a fast-growing luxury lifestyle business, specializing in women\u2019s, men\u2019s, and<br>children\u2019s apparel.
