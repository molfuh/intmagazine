Gosh. Kids are getting cranky and witching hour is upon us, and you still have to do bath time and bed time.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here&#8217;s a quick fix meal that feed your family, give them the nutrients they need, that won&#8217;t wreck your kitchen or your sanity.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Asian Salmon<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Preheat Oven to 420<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Asian Salmon:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Take a large piece of fresh salmon and pour a Soy\/Teriyaki marinade on it. (My personal favorite is the SOYYAKI from Trader Joes)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Take a bottle of Asian Sweet chili sauce (any brand will do) and pour a little swirl of it on top. Spread with a spoon to make it even.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Take &#8220;Everything but bagel&#8221; seasoning (trader joes has it) or you can use a combo of poppy seeds, and sesame seeds and sprinkle on top.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Pop in oven for 15 min. Broil for 2 min after to brown the top.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>While Salmon cooks: boil jasmine rice (follow instructions on box or microwave) and in a wok or pan, heat Olive oil and some fresh garlic together. Add sugar snap peas to the garlic oil. Cook for 5-8 min depending on firmness preferred.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Voila! Once salmon is done, serve on rice and accompany with snap peas on the side. Your family will thank you. And kids will get to bed on time so you can &#8220;Netflix and Chill&#8221; (and I&#8217;m talking about actually watching Netflix and Chilling&#8230; not the slang)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Multitasking fit it in tip&#8221;: While dinner is cooking, get your toddlers or kids to set the table. It&#8217;s a great practice to get them used to.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For easy 5 min clean up: Lay parchment paper or foil on baking sheet when baking salmon. No Mess! Use a wok for snap peas if you have (most woks should not be cleaned, they should just be wiped with oil).&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>It&#8217;s 5:30pm already! Gosh.
