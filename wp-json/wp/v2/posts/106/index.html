From winning 26 out of 38 award nominations to securing invitations to over 15 film<br>festivals, the film has accumulated quite a collection of accolades and has made quite the name<br>for itself all across the world.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><br>\u201cThe Divide\u201d stars some of the most recognizable names in Hollywood \u2013 to call it star-studded<br>would truly be an understatement. The film stars Bryan Kaplan (Chronicles of Jessica Wu, Cult<br>of Eden), Sara Arrington (Stargirl, The Jungle Book), Levi Kreis (A Very Sordid Wedding, Don&#8217;t<br>Let Go), Luke Colombero (Operation: Neighborhood Watch!, The Pretty One) and Perry King<br>(The Day After Tomorrow, The Hasty Heart) as well. If this is not enough to impress viewers,<br>then Jana Brown\u2019s writing will be.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><br>Brown, a graduate of Dartmouth College, has amassed her own collection of awards and<br>honors for her enthralling storytelling. She has won \u201cBest Foreign Feature,\u201d \u201cBest First Time<br>Screenwriter,\u201d \u201cBest Modern Western Screenplay,\u201d \u201cBest First Time Feature Filmmakers,\u201d and<br>has even won the International Independent Film Awards&#8217; coveted \u201cSilver Award &#8211; Screenplay.\u201d<br>However, while she has clearly found great success in screenplay writing, her first breakout<br>piece was actually \u201cThe Divide.\u201d Before getting into screenplay writing, Brown had spent much<br>of her career in the publishing and print industry. Later on, she worked as a freelance content<br>creator until she found her calling and took on \u201cThe Divide.\u201d Since the film\u2019s incredible debut,<br>Brown has also written two books and begun work on a number of new screenplays.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><br>Perry King makes up the other half of this dynamic duo that brought \u201cThe Divide\u201d to incredible<br>heights. King portrayed Sam Kincaide in the film and also worked behind the scenes as the<br>director of \u201cThe Divide.\u201d Though King is a veteran of the entertainment industry, having acted in<br>a number of films, this film marked the first time he was ever behind the camera. While he<br>lacked director experience, the accolades he received for his work would say otherwise \u2013 King<br>received \u201cBest First Time Director,\u201d \u201cPlatinum Remi Award for Best Western,\u201d \u201cSilver Award,<br>Narrative Feature,\u201d \u201cBest Dramatic Feature,\u201d and \u201cDebut Filmmaker Award.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><br>\u201cThe Divide\u201d is filmed entirely in black and white, mixing modernity and class to portray the story<br>of one man\u2019s struggles with various droughts in his life. &#8220;I can&#8217;t imagine [The Divide] being<br>anything but black and white. The old black and white films, those are what I love the most,&#8221;<br>said King in a recent interview. King finds a way to beautifully encapsulate the themes of classic<br>American westerns, modern cinematography, and black and white filmmaking in a single film.<br>The storyline is set in 1976 and follows a drought-plagued ranch in Northern California in an<br>area only known as \u201cthe divide.\u201d Sam Kincaid (King) is waging a losing battle against<br>Alzheimer\u2019s disease, a barren landscape, and a tragic past. After realizing that this battle will<br>only end one way, a migrant ranch hand (Kaplan) enlists the help of Sam\u2019s estranged daughter<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>(Sara Arrington) to care for him at the ranch. Her arrival uncovers a long and dark family history,<br>highlighting the consequences of absence.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><br>Over the course of the film, Kincaid attempts to reconcile with his daughter, his grandson<br>(Colembero) seeks a father figure, and Tom Cutler (Kreis) embarks on a mission to settle the<br>score with Sam. The many droughts in the divide are unrelenting, and Kincaid\u2019s daughter Sarah<br>maintains a similar attitude as she seeks out peace of mind in the wake of her father\u2019s past<br>failures. &#8220;Drought of the land, drought of your family and your personal life. And for this old man<br>I play, drought of the mind,&#8221; commented King.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Three years since its debut, \u201cThe Divide\u201d continues to captivate audiences, film critics, andmany more.
