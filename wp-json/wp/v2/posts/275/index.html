Her<br>art is described as creative, vibrant, abstract work with \u201cstreet art edginess\u201d. Her works<br>contain bright colors and motifs of hearts and other positive symbols. She uses the word<br>\u201clove\u201d repeatedly and really drives home the positive vibes with colors such as yellow,<br>red, and teal.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><br>Her work can be found in many galleries such as ArtSpace Warehouse, Ethos<br>Contemporary, Kevin Barry and Kunstwarenhaus. Her art spreads across miles, from<br>Los Angeles to Atlanta in the United States, and even to Switzerland. She has many<br>pieces in high-profile clientele homes, and even many hotels have curated her art<br>across the country. She has painted pianos, store fronts, and has some sculptures. With<br>positive vibes and messages many need to hear, it is no surprise she was an instant hit.<br>One of her most incredible accomplishments continues to break art boundaries as it<br>crosses from canvas to clothing. She has done a few collaborations with famed fashion<br>designer Isabel Marant, which is a huge step for artists. Celebrities such as Reese<br>Witherspoon, Rosie Huntington, Jennifer Aniston and Gigi Haddid have been seen<br>rocking styles by the designer. This collaboration was groundbreaking and forged a<br>collaboration that was wearable and brought positivity to those who wore it.<br>Goldhammer&#8217;s motifs can be found on pieces such as dresses, skirts, pants, and more<br>in both men\u2019s and women\u2019s styles.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"731\" src=\"https:\/\/intmagazine.netlify.app\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/22d6ce11-64ba-48e2-b3ed-148ebdb4371b.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-279\" srcset=\"https:\/\/intmagazine.netlify.app\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/22d6ce11-64ba-48e2-b3ed-148ebdb4371b.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/intmagazine.netlify.app\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/22d6ce11-64ba-48e2-b3ed-148ebdb4371b-300x214.jpg 300w, https:\/\/intmagazine.netlify.app\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/22d6ce11-64ba-48e2-b3ed-148ebdb4371b-768x548.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p><br>Fans cannot wait to see future collections and what Goldhammer does next.
