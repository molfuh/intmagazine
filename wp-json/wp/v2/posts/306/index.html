I eat well, exercise, pursue my dreams, travel, have a healthy marriage, and still manage to give my kids quality time. How do I do it? I get asked this question almost every day from other moms or people my age. I am a master of multi-tasking. My philosophy is: don\u2019t let your kids stop your life, live your life and have them be a PART of it! I take my kids everywhere and i\u2019ve incorporated my children in a lot of the things I enjoy, in particularly exercise. My baby is the best kettle bell in town and my jogging stroller makes a great ballet barre. The key is time management and planning ahead. One of the things I do to plan ahead for my week is meal prep. I cook a bunch of healthy, and accessible options so that when I\u2019m in a pinch, rushing out the door, trying to feed a HANGRY toddler or husband, or dealing with unexpected meltdowns, myself and my whole family have something to nourish them. This led to me owning an running a successful boutique\u00a0meal service in Los angeles called &#8220;Fitbritt&#8217;s Kitch&#8221;. I meal prep and cook for people on a weekly basis. I plan to share some of my easiest go to &#8220;quick fix&#8221; recipes on my page so stay tuned!!\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cFitBritt\u2019 is a little online forum I started a few years ago when my daughter Leili was born. I didn&#8217;t have the time or money to hire a sitter to go to the gym and workout, so I used my baby. She was a good solid 18lbs and gave me quite the workout. I got creative. These videos gained a lot of popularity on social media. I would get a lot of messages of people telling me I inspired them. I started getting a following. However, because this was something I just did for fun, I got busy with other things and then stopped making content. Then I gave birth to my second child, Luca. I started doing some videos again. The feedback I got was amazing.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then I stopped. I thought, is this what I really want to be doing? A food service business? A Mommy and me fitness instructor? I moved to Hollywood to be in the entertainment business, to be \u201con the big screen\u201d. However, my eyes were opened from a very successful female entrepreneur friend of mine to think BIGGER. I was thinking too small. FITBRITT was not just a little meal service I was doing, or little Facebook videos, it was my BRAND. If you truly know me, you will find I am the ultimate multi-tasker, and I do a lot of things. Not only am I a mom with a training and nutrition background, I\u2019m a writer, actress, singer, dancer, director, stand up comedienne, chef, photographer&#8230; As my entrepreneurial friend pointed out \u2014 \u201cI DO IT ALL\u201d. AHA! I realized \u201cFit\u201d doesn\u2019t stand for fitness, but for \u201cFIT IT IN\u201d. This is what speaks to people. This is what I can do \u2014 Inspire Millennial moms worldwide to FIT IT IN. They\u00a0don\u2019t have to limit themselves and become so one dimensional. They can do it all, they just need to plan ahead and figure out a way that works for them.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So welcome to my page. A stomping ground for Moms of all ages to receive tips and tricks and inspiration of how to &#8220;Fit it in&#8221;.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8211; Fit Britt<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Who am I?
