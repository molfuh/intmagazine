The Enlightened Kingdom film production company released the first trailer for<br>their historical drama, &#8216;The Lady of Heaven&#8217; on Film Selects the YouTube Trailer platform.<br>The trailer has gained reaction videos from countries everywhere, including from the UK,<br>Thailand, India, Poland, Netherlands, Romania, Brazil, Kenya, Jamaica, Iceland, Russia,<br>Denmark, New Zealand, Algeria, Italy, Georgia, Morocco, Malaysia, and Cyprus.<br>Since then, The Lady of Heaven trailer has caught the viewer&#8217;s attention, with views reaching<br>nearly two million in under a month. With thousands of reposts already, The Lady of Heaven<br>trailer&#8217;s comments section was garnering close to one hundred thousand before being turned<br>off.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><br>There have been over 1,000 reaction videos to The Lady of Heaven trailer, and the number of<br>videos popping up is growing every single day. Naturally, the trailer release has generated a<br>significant amount of excitement online, generating reposts worldwide, Instagram accounts<br>based on the film, and buildup on social media rarely seen for a non-studio film.<br>The phenomenal reaction from The Lady of Heaven\u2019s fan base could be in part due to the<br>quality of the filmmaking and the story of the film itself. The film covers a story and a multitude<br>of themes that have never been discussed previously on the big screens. The nature of the film<br>itself is causing audiences to share what they have seen and to talk about their experiences<br>watching the trailer.<br>The Lady of Heaven covers two storylines simultaneously throughout the duration of the film.<br>On one end, the plight of an Iraqi child who tragically loses his mother during the war, and on<br>the other end, the agonizing journey of the Lady Fatima, daughter of the Prophet Muhammad.<br>The Lady of Heaven depicts two plots separated by 1400 years. First, Laith&#8217;s story as an orphan<br>growing up amidst a war-torn country, who learns the lesson of power and patience. Second,<br>Lady Fatima&#8217;s story as the first victim of terrorism and the terrors she had to endure.<br>&#8220;The Lady is held dear in the hearts of billions worldwide, but her story has never been shared<br>through film. Her story is a universal one that we can all learn from, teaching us the best<br>response to corruption and to power hungry politicians,&#8221; the filmmakers say.<br>This message has become highly relevant, especially today, where the media is causing people<br>to look at what politicians are doing daily. It is not a coincidence that audiences feel compelled<br>to share their reactions to the film&#8217;s trailer or that there have been over 1,000 fan reaction<br>videos made.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"640\" src=\"https:\/\/intmagazine.netlify.app\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/image_123986672-2-1024x640.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-161\" srcset=\"https:\/\/intmagazine.netlify.app\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/image_123986672-2-1024x640.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/intmagazine.netlify.app\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/image_123986672-2-300x188.jpg 300w, https:\/\/intmagazine.netlify.app\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/image_123986672-2-768x480.jpg 768w, https:\/\/intmagazine.netlify.app\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/image_123986672-2-1536x960.jpg 1536w, https:\/\/intmagazine.netlify.app\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/image_123986672-2-2048x1280.jpg 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;The Lady is a powerful and important historical character that many in the world have never<br>been introduced to. The film is also exceptionally historically accurate. We worked tirelessly to<br>ensure that all aspects of the film are linked to historical records, from the characters, to the<br>scenes, to clothing, armoury, pottery, houses, etc. Everything was painstakingly researched,&#8221;<br>the filmmakers say.<br>In Iraq, the film&#8217;s trailer has gained massive support and has been overwhelmingly positive, due<br>in part to the Iraqi heritage represented in its storyline. Across the country, the people have<br>taken it upon themselves to print out movie posters for the film and plaster them across the<br>streets to support the film.<br>Fans of The Lady of Heaven have downloaded the trailer from its YouTube platform and<br>projected it on big screens at intersections across all the main cities in Iraq.<br>&#8220;There are 250 films on Jesus Christ, 120 films about Moses, 80 about the other Prophets, and<br>40 films about Buddha, but there are none about the life of Lady Fatima the Daughter of the<br>Prophet Muhammed, until now,&#8221; Hussain Ashmere, Executive Producer says.<br>We asked, why now? Why did you choose to create this story and release it as a feature film<br>during these times?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><br>&#8220;In a time of global uncertainty and hardship, the Lady&#8217;s story is a much-needed message of<br>patience, hope, and strength,&#8221; Abdul-Malik Shlibak, Executive Producer, said.<br>&#8220;This film conveys a message of love and peace. It is a call to a better mindset when dealing<br>with challenges. I am certain that should humanity follow in the steps of The Lady, peace,<br>justice, and equality will prevail and triumph. I pray for this to happen,&#8221; the film&#8217;s writer Sheikh<br>Al-Habib adds.<br>One of the main challenges that the filmmakers had to overcome was accurately depicting holy<br>figures without disrespecting religious codes. Thankfully, with newly developed technology,<br>audiences will be able to see that these elements have been executed thoughtfully in respect of<br>the religious topics in the film.<br>Producers of the film state, &#8220;Following Islamic tradition, no individual represented a Holy<br>Personality during the making of this film. The performances of the Holy Personalities were<br>achieved through a unique synthesis of actors, in-camera effects, lighting, and visual effects.&#8221;<br>With a budget of $15 Million, filmed in Georgia and London, England, the movie is described by<br>John Stephenson OBE, Creative Consultant for the film, as &#8220;Lawrence of Arabia meets Game of<br>Thrones.&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"640\" src=\"https:\/\/intmagazine.netlify.app\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/image_123986672-1024x640.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-162\" srcset=\"https:\/\/intmagazine.netlify.app\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/image_123986672-1024x640.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/intmagazine.netlify.app\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/image_123986672-300x188.jpg 300w, https:\/\/intmagazine.netlify.app\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/image_123986672-768x480.jpg 768w, https:\/\/intmagazine.netlify.app\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/image_123986672-1536x960.jpg 1536w, https:\/\/intmagazine.netlify.app\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/image_123986672-2048x1280.jpg 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Filmmakers have been ecstatic with the responses towards the film since its release last<br>December, despite the restrictions that the pandemic has previously placed on them.
